# Contributing

Thanks for your interest. Issues and pull requests are welcome.

## Building and running

- `npm install` to install dependencies. Node 22 or newer (`npm test` leaves its
  glob to Node, which only expands one from Node 21).
- `npm run watch` (or `npm run compile`), then press F5 in VS Code to launch an Extension Development Host with the extension loaded.
- `npm run check-types` type checks and `npm test` runs every suite: the webview, the settings panel, the chat controller, the working set, the ACP client, and the CLI helpers.
- `npm run package` builds a `.vsix` you can install with `code --install-extension`.
- `npm run preview -- --scenario full` opens a mock chat in a browser for fast UI iteration without the CLI. See [the screenshots guide](docs/screenshots.md) for the scenarios behind the README images and how to regenerate them.
- `npm run preview:settings` does the same for the settings panel. It takes `--section <id>`, `--multi-root` (two workspace folders, so the scope tabs show both), and `--empty` (nothing configured, for the empty states). The mock payload lives in `scripts/settings-fixture.js` and is shared with the tests.

## Releasing

Releases are automated. To cut one:

1. Add the new version's entry to [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md). The release notes are taken from it.
2. Bump the version and create the tag: `npm version patch` (or `minor` / `major`).
3. Push it: `git push --follow-tags`.

The [release workflow](.github/workflows/release.yml) then type checks, tests, builds the extension, creates a GitHub Release with the `.vsix` attached, and publishes to the VS Code Marketplace (and Open VSX). The release body is the matching `CHANGELOG.md` section (via `scripts/changelog-notes.js`) with GitHub's "Full Changelog" link appended, so if the entry is missing the notes fall back to a link to the changelog. The [CI workflow](.github/workflows/ci.yml) runs the same checks on every push and pull request, and the type check and tests again on Windows and macOS, since the extension runs wherever VS Code does.

One time setup for Marketplace publishing:

- Create the `shayanline` publisher on the [Marketplace publisher portal](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/manage).
- Generate an Azure DevOps personal access token scoped to Marketplace, Manage.
- Add it as a repository Actions secret named `VSCE_PAT` (and optionally `OVSX_PAT` for Open VSX).

While `"preview": true` is set in `package.json`, the Marketplace listing keeps the preview badge.
