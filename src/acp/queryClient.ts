// Ask a `devin acp` a question, outside any chat.
//
// Some of what the CLI knows is only available over the protocol and only with a
// session open: which rules and hooks are actually loaded, for instance, which the
// settings panel would otherwise have to guess by scanning for files it knows the
// names of (and get wrong, since a plugin or another tool can contribute them).
//
// The panel has no chat, so this opens an agent for the length of the question and
// then closes it. The session it needs is deleted on the way out, because a session
// is listed the moment it is created and leaving debris in the user's own session
// list to answer a settings panel would be its own bug.
//
// Prefer an already running agent where there is one (`ChatController` hands its
// client over): this exists for the cold case, not to be the normal path.
// Every agent opened for a question and not yet closed. A `devin acp` cannot outlive
// the extension host any more than a chat's can, and this one is nobody's chat, so it
// is in no surface's pool and no shutdown pass walked it: closing the window during
// the seconds a question takes left it running with its MCP servers and the CLI's
// lock, which on Windows nothing reaps.
