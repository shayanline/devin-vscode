// Headless harness for the host side of a chat (src/chat/chatViewProvider.ts).
//
// This is the piece the test suite was missing. Everything the chat controller does
// happens across an await: spawning an agent, opening a session, replaying history,
// waking a chat that had exited. The bugs that keep being found in it are all the
// same shape, a chat finishing that work into a panel that has moved on, and none of
// them could be tested, so each was found by someone noticing a symptom and each fix
// was made by reading. This runs the real controller, against a real `devin acp`
// conversation, with the timing under the test's control.
//
// It is the real thing on both sides of the seam:
//   - the real ChatController, ChangeTracker, SessionStore, AcpClient and
//     TerminalManager, compiled out of src/ with `vscode` aliased to vscode-stub.js
//   - a fake agent that is a genuine ACP peer over stdio, and answers the CLI's
//     `--version` and `auth status` too, so even the health check is the real path
//
// The agent's delays are what makes the interleavings reachable: `newDelay` and
// `loadDelay` hold session/new and session/load open for as long as a test needs to
// do something else, which is the window every one of these bugs lives in.
