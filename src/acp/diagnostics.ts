//
// This is the one thing a native editor client can tell Devin that the CLI in a
// terminal cannot: what the editor already knows is wrong, without spawning a
// compiler or a linter to find out. The agent pulls it on its own schedule.
//
// It is a filter, not a dump. A big workspace reports thousands of diagnostics and
// they would crowd everything else out of the agent's context, so:
//  - errors and warnings only (hints and information are editor UI, not defects)
//  - inside the workspace, since a diagnostic in a dependency is not actionable
//  - files the agent has touched this session first, because those are the ones it
//    is working on and the ones its own edits may have broken
//  - capped, with errors ahead of warnings inside each group

// How many diagnostics the agent is handed at once.
